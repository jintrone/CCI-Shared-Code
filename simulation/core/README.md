BACKGROUND
**********

This is the current root of the Radically Open Modeling Architecture (ROMA) platform.  

ROMA is designed to allow multiple simulation models to be integrated via a common API.  ROMA provides functionality to hook different models together an perform tranformations on the data stream between models.  

In addition, to running models, ROMA provides:

-- meta data about each individual model
-- the ability to store an index prior model runs
-- the ability to create new models from an excel spreadsheet

A comprehensive description of this software is available at [1].
